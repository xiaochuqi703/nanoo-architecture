      description: "The “All-weather Promenade” Substation centers on the concept of “sharing and integration,” exploring a symbiotic relationship between urban infrastructure and public life. The proposal optimizes the originally enclosed and isolated 110 kV substation interface by adjusting the building and driveway layout, releasing the site’s edges back to the public and transforming it into an accessible, inhabitable, and activity-friendly public space. Within the constraints of equipment clearance and operational safety, the building’s volume is moderately reduced, and its roofline extends toward the site boundaries. The space between the eaves and the perimeter wall forms a semi-open corridor—the “All-weather Promenade.” This public passageway not only provides shelter from sun and rain but also serves as a key public node along the riverside promenade, creating a comfortable environment for walking, jogging, and leisure. According to the site’s varying orientations and spatial characteristics, pavilions, viewing terraces, and fitness facilities are embedded within the promenade, shaping a vibrant riverside hub where a once single-purpose infrastructure evolves into a public platform for diverse activities.Formally, the roof and façade are designed as an integrated surface, producing a coherent and unified architectural expression. Clad in blue-green aluminum panels, the substation blends naturally with the surrounding park and river landscape. The use of standing seam panels ensures a clean, durable, and economical construction. Sustainability principles run throughout the design. Photovoltaic panels on the roof supply clean energy to the pavilions and fitness facilities, reducing external power dependence and creating a self-sustaining green system that also communicates the concept of low-carbon living in a direct and tangible way.Through optimized layout, integration of public space, and use of renewable energy, the “All-weather Promenade” transforms the substation from an urban barrier into a walkable, usable, and perceptible civic corridor—ensuring safe, efficient energy operation while endowing the site with new public value and enhancing both urban functionality and quality of life.",

      description: "The site on Yanqing Road is located at the core of the Hengfu Historic Conservation Area. It carries the city’s collective memory and historical continuity while providing a natural stage for commerce, leisure, and cultural activities—becoming a must-visit destination where residents and visitors alike can stroll, explore, and experience the city’s charm.Distinct from the surrounding areas known for upscale retail and tourist-oriented commerce, Yanqing Road retains a quieter, more lived-in atmosphere, rich with the potential for community cultural exchange. This proposal takes local handcrafted food, lifestyle retail, and community-friendly businesses as its starting point to create a lively “slow-living” street full of neighborhood warmth. By optimizing outdoor seating and the pedestrian system, “Plane Tree Rest Stations” are set every 50 meters to foster a relaxed, communal atmosphere. At the street’s end, the Yanqing Road No. 9 Market will be transformed into a “Long Table Living Room,” serving both daily consumption and social interaction needs while opening itself to connect residents and visitors—where everyday urban life and collective memory converge.Currently, the market’s internal spaces are loosely connected, and its façades remain closed off. The proposal introduces shared long tables and exhibition areas to create an integrated space combining “fresh market – community kitchen – cultural experience.” This will serve as an incubator for creative IPs based on local snacks and intangible culinary heritage, revitalizing the community. Spatially, the proposal opens up the Yanqing Road façade and reorganizes circulation through loops and passages that connect with the surrounding landscape—enhancing visibility, guiding foot traffic inward, and positioning the market as the vibrant core of the slow-living street. The architectural materials along the road are diverse, reflecting the elegance of Shanghai’s Haipai style. In the market renovation, new materials such as wood, terrazzo, jade-hued grilles, and recycled plastics are introduced—echoing the historic textures and colors while incorporating a contemporary sensibility, creating a harmonious yet layered streetscape. Unlike traditional wet markets, the “Long Table Living Room” is envisioned as a local culinary IP incubation hub. By hosting seasonal and festive food experience events that integrate display, tasting, and sales, the project builds synergy between offline engagement and online communication—gradually shaping a distinctive gastronomic identity for the Hengfu district. Meanwhile, the shared long table will also be open for booking by brands and residents alike, encouraging co-creation and strengthening community bonds.",

      description: "This project is located in Waigaoqiao, Pudong District, Shanghai, near the historic Gaoqiao Old Town. The client commissioned the renovation of the four-story podium of the Lefei Tower into a hotel. The ground floor will feature the hotel lobby, restaurant, and bar, while the second to fourth floors will house guest rooms. The hotel is designed to serve business travelers in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, as well as tourists and family guests.In response to the local architectural context, the façade has been redesigned in a Shanghai-style Art Deco aesthetic. The design also incorporates new  smoke exhaust windows, balancing functional requirements with visual harmony. Great care has been taken to preserve as much of the original stone façade as possible, minimizing alterations while ensuring a cohesive and elegant appearance. The façade of the bar area at the southwest corner is designed with folding doors, which can be fully opened when needed to connect the indoor bar with the outdoor seating area. Together with the food truck across the street, it creates a lively mini commercial street within the site.",

      description: "The project is located in Luoshan Village on the shore of Shijiu Lake, once a fishing settlement by livelihood. Today, many of the village houses are old and dilapidated, and the spatial texture has become blurred, yet the site still preserves a unique scene where stone walls, trees, and lake reflections intertwine. The design takes the “fishing net” and “fishing lantern” as its core concepts, extracting spatial logic and renewal strategies from the village’s traditional way of life to explore a reconstruction path where the old and new coexist and nature and culture are interwoven.The “fishing net” symbolizes connection and stands as the most representative emblem of fishing culture. Inspired by this, the project removes buildings with little heritage value, preserves existing stone walls and trees, and uses lightweight corridors to “weave” new threads into the original spatial fabric—allowing old and new structures to intertwine and continue the memory of the place.The “fishing lantern” symbolizes hope and gathering—the spiritual essence of fishermen’s life in the night. New buildings draw from this imagery, appearing as glowing dots floating upon the “net.” By day, they accommodate a mix of functions such as study tours, dining, and lodging; by night, their lights reflect upon the lake, composing a poetic scene of “lanterns rising over the fishing village.” The program volumes are relatively independent, connected by corridors and courtyards, creating a layered circulation and an open, fluid spatial experience.“Reweaving the Light of the Fishery” represents both spatial reconstruction and cultural regeneration. Through the “net’s” connections and the “lantern’s” illumination, the design reweaves the memory of the fishing village into contemporary life—reviving the warmth and vitality of the countryside and marking a new chapter in the rural revitalization along the shores of Shijiu Lake.",

      description: "This project is located at the intersection of Qingfeng Avenue and Qiushi Street in Longgang District, Shenzhen. The site area is 9,007.27 sqm, with a total building area of 22,763 sqm. The design reconfigures the campus layout with a spatial strategy centered on optimizing the orientation of the playground. By rotating the playground 10 degrees westward from the north-south axis, it achieves optimal sun exposure while naturally dividing the site into two main functional zones: the teaching and living area, and the community-sharing area.On the west side, a clear, cluster-based layout is adopted. The teaching zone forms a quiet academic cluster through efficient modular units. The adjacent living area, connected via sheltered walkways, is spaced for comfort and maintains both functional independence and convenient integration, together shaping a calm and orderly campus core.The east side is dedicated to a multifunctional activity zone, housing spaces such as the library, rehearsal hall, and club rooms, all designed to be shared with the community. An independent circulation path near the main road allows these areas to open to the public outside school hours, promoting a soft integration of educational and urban life.Art classrooms and exhibition-capable spaces are linked in a gallery-like corridor that connects the teaching area with the activity zone, forming the main indoor bridge between the two. This spatial restructuring, grounded in both educational functionality and community sharing, creates a transparent, vibrant new type of learning cluster.",

      description: "The design concept originates from the historical background of the Zhangshi Jialetang’s former owner, the worker of Qingfeng textile factory. By leveraging the transparency and fluidity of textiles, we transform the building into a multifunctional space integrating a traditional folk art experience workshop themed on textile, co-working areas, and a tea house. Soft textiles serve as the medium for spatial creation, enveloping the interior of the historic building to craft new experiential scenes for staying, exploring, displaying, and resting. We open up the originally enclosed urban facade, creating a 24/7 shared open art workshop space within the site, extending it as a continuation of the city’s public space. Textiles are not only physical mediums but also symbolize the connection between people and space, history and culture, fostering a slow-paced, warm spatial experience that allows visitors to feel the gentle touch of time and cultural heritage within the embrace of textiles.",
